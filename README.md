### Tackling the translation challenge

Finding the right tool to translate files with numerical data can be surprisingly tricky. Often, built-in Excel features, macros, or online resources don’t quite cut it, especially when translating specific language pairs. 

One day I ran into this problem while trying to translate files from Russian to Ukrainian for business documentation. Existing tools just weren't up to the task. So, that's how appeared idea of creating a custom tool to handle this specific translation need, making it easier to convert data files accurately and meet business requirements.

## Features

- **Automatic File Detection:** The script automatically detects the first Excel file in the current directory.
- **Language Translation:** Translates text from one language to another using the `translate` library.
- **Progress Indicator:** Displays a progress indicator while processing the translation.
- **Output Naming:** Saves the translated file with a prefix indicating the target language.

## Installation

To install the required libraries, run:

```bash
python 3.11.9
```
```bash
pip install translate pandas
```

## Usage

1. Download the **translate_excel.py** file. Place it along with aimed .xlsx file in the same folder. Open a terminal and navigate to this folder.
2. Run the translation script from the command line as follows:
```bash
python translate_excel.py [from_lang] [to_lang]
```
- `from_lang`: The language code of the source language (e.g., `"ru"` for Russian).
- `to_lang`: The language code of the target language (e.g., `"uk"` for Ukrainian).
  
## Languages Catalogue
Look into - **catalogue.txt**

### Example

To translate an Excel file from Russian to Ukrainian:
```bash
python translate_excel.py ru uk
```

**IMPORTANT**: This script will process the **first** .xlsx file it finds in the directory. **Ensure that only one excel file you want to translate is in the folder!**
